# Traits are reusable classes allowing horziontal reuse of a method selection.
# They permit multiple inheritance while solving the diamond problem. If the
# body of a trait method is omitted, the method is considered abstract.
# Therefore, traits can be used just like an interface in Java.

# There are the following restrictions:
# - Traits cannot have parameters such as classes.
# - Traits cannot define constructors.
# - Traits can only extend other traits.

# Define a new trait for all common methods and default actions.

		(o as World).say() # Hello World
