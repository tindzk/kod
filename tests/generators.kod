# Generators can be used to implement iterators. Generators preserve the local
# state between the function calls. Therefore, they are suitable to implement
# complex state-oriented iteration techniques such as binary tree traversal.

# Generate the Fibonacci sequence using a generator.
def Generator fibonacci():
	let (i, j) = (0, 1)
	while True:
		yield i
		(i, j) = (j, i + j)

# We can use the generator as an iterator.
for number in fibonacci():
	println(number)

# The result of fibonacci() is callable.
Generator fib = fibonacci()
[Int] numbers = [fib() for i in 0..100]

# As Generator implements the trait `Collection', we can shorten this to:
[Int] numbers = fib.take(100)
