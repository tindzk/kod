# A map is a collection providing a key-to-value mapping. A key therefore has to
# be unique. For each key, there can only be one value. Also, the order of the
# entries is not defined.

# Infers the type {Int: Str} which is equivalent to Map<Int, Str>.

# Add one element.
names.add(2, "Linus Torvalds")

# Similarly, the index operator could be used.

# add() is overloaded and may also take a map.

# Adding one or more elements using the + operator (does not modify the original
# map).
