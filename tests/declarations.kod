# When declaring a new variable, a value must always be bound.
let value := "Hello World" # Str
let i := 5 # Int
let b := True # Bool

# Changing the value of a previously declared variable.
i := 6

# Nullable variables must be explicitly denoted accordingly. See nullable.kod.
let value2 := None as Str?

# Declaring variables using type inference involves the use of the `let' keyword.
let i := 5
let b := True

# The type was statically determined and cannot be changed. Only Boolean values
# are valid for the variable `b'.
b := False

# Assigning None to an untyped variable is invalid as the type cannot be inferred.
let value3 := None

# Tuple unpacking.
let (c, d) := (1, "Hello World")

# Swap the values of x and y.
let x := 2
let y := 3
(x, y) := (y, x)
