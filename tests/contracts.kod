# A contract is a language construct facilitating verification and code
# optimisations by specifying pre- and postconditions. The compiler gets more
# information about the methods and can use this contextual information to
# produce more efficient code.

# Contracts encourage the developer to think more about possible input and
# output values, i.e., which values can the method possibly take and return.
# This leads ultimately to more robust code.

# Contracts may be independent from the implementation. This can be used if the
# employer provides a trait with all methods that have to be implemented along
# with pre- and postconditions. The developer can already verify the
# implementation at an early stage. At the same time he has a better overall
# understanding of what has to be implemented and how the methods interact with
# each other.

# Contracts serve also documentation purposes. Usually, input and output
# parameters are documented in textual form (comments). Instead, contracts allow
# to do this in a consistent and unambiugous way by specifying evaluable
# expressions.

# Contracts respect the class hierarchy and when a class is inherited, the
# contracts of the overriding class must not be violated.

# Runtime checks can be deactivated completely in a shipping version of the
# program to prevent unnecessary overhead. For this reason contracts must not be
# seen as a replacement for proper error handling and the code must not rely on
# the contracts being evaluated. Contracts should be considered solely as a
# means to find programmer mistakes more quickly.

# See also types.kod for another possibility of doing design by contract
# (abstracting from a data type and restricting the value set).
