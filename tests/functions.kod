# A method signature followed by a colon expects a statement block whereas a
# single expression is expected after an equal sign. This latter alternative
# syntax was introduce as it shortens wrapper methods and is closer to the
# mathematical notation as can be seen in the following examples.

# No type inference:
Int addOne(Int i):
	return i + 1

# With type inference:
addOne(i):
	return i + 1

# Shorter:
addOne(i) = i + 1

# Recursive method:
Int f(Int x):
	if x = 0: return 5
	else:     return x + f(0)

# Shorter:
f(x) = x = 0 ? 5 \
	             : x + f(0)

# Functions with Unicode identifiers.
