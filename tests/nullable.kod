# All types are either nullable or non-nullable. The latter guarantees that such
# a type never stores the None value. A nullable type is indicated with a
# trailing question mark. By analogy, only when explicitly specified, a variable
# can store the None value.
#
# - Str never stores None.
# - Str? may store None.
#
# The compiler can directly catch programming mistakes during compile-time like
# statically assigning None to a non-nullable type. At runtime additional checks
# are implicitly performed when coercing a nullable value to a non-nullable
# type. This has the advantage that the code fails as early as possible, notably
# exactly there where the bug was introduced rather than propagating it into
# unrelated code fragments.
#
# In contrast to other programming languages such as Scala or Haskell, this is a
# direct language feature and does not map to a class such as Option.

# There is only one restriction in conjunction with type inference: A type
# cannot be inferred if the default value of the variable is None. This cannot
# be solved as the following is always ambiguous (`a' could be of any type).
#
#  let a := None
#
# In this case, the developer needs to specify the type explicitly:
Int? b := None

let val  := b # val is of type Int?.
Int val2 := b # Unboxes automatically. When the value is None, a runtime-time
              # exception is thrown.

# As to make unboxing safer, the Elvis operator was introduced. It only unboxes
# the expression if it does not evaluate to None. Otherwise the given
# alternative value is taken.
let val := a ?: 10

# This is short for (with the difference that `a' gets only evaluated once):
let val := a != None ? a : 10
let val := a ? a : 10

# The RHS of the ?: operation can also be a statement. This is useful for error
# handling. Considering that find() returns User?, `user' is correctly inferred
# to be of the type User. If unboxing fails, a UserNotFound exception is thrown.
let user := User.find("Linus Torvalds") ?: raise UserNotFound()

# The Safe Access operator allows accessing attributes and methods of a
# nullable value while avoiding an exception if the value is null. It just
# returns null if this is the case.
# The operator is particularly useful when following a chain of nullable
# references as it significantly reduces the number of None-checks.

User? user := User.find("Linus Torvalds")
String? street := user?.address?.street # street is null if user, address or street is null.

# Other examples:
foo?.bar
foo?.bar()?.foo()
foo?.bar[0]?.foo()
