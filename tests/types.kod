# While the `class' keyword operates on composed data types, `type' operates
# on base types. It has multiple purposes:
# - Create an alias for a (complex) type such as a lambda function.
# - Compile-time as well as runtime verification for instantiations of this
#   data type.

type DefaultCallback is Void ()
type Int64 is Int.Bits64

# Declare a new data type `Person' mapping a name of a person to its age.
type Person is Map<Str, Int>

# Shorter:
type Person is {Str: Int}

# Alias an enumeration and restrict its value set with a rule. This allows
# design by contract.
enum Day is 1..31
type OddDay i is Day = i.isOdd()

# Regular expressions.
type Email s is Str:
	expr := "complex regular expression"
	s.matches(expr)

# Person can be used in place of {Str: Int}:
Person people := {
	"a": 12,
	"b": 13
}

OddDay day := 2 # Compile-time error.

Email mail := "foo@bar.org" # Valid.

# During compile-time all methods that do not have any side-effects are marked
# as `pure'. In `type' only those methods can be used. For example, opening a
# TCP connection to verify whether a domain is accessible would be an impure
# operation. Similarly, generating random numbers is impure and therefore not
# permitted in `type'.
