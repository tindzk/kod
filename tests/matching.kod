# match blocks are similar to switch..case blocks with some differences:
#  - Ranges can be matched.
#  - Types can be matched (-> with implicit casting).
#  - Lists of types can be matched.
#  - Class parameters can be extracted.
#  - Fall-through is not supported. Therefore, there is no need to use a keyword
#    such as `break' to prevent the execution of the subsequent cases as in C.
